\description{
\code{GVectors} can contain a mix of "singlepart" and "multipart" features. A singlepart feature is a single point, set of connected line segments, or a polygon. A multipart feature is a set of lines, sets of connected line segments, or set of polygons that are treated as a single feature. This function converts all multipart features to singlepart features. If the \code{GVector} has an attribute table, rows will be duplicated so that each of the new \code{GVector}'s geometries have the rows that correspond to their "parent" geometries.

If you want to "split" cells of a \code{GRaster} into smaller cells, use \code{\link[=aggregate]{aggregate()}}.

# These should be the same.
agg2terra <- aggregate(madElev, 2)

agg2 <- rast(agg2)
agg2 <- extend(agg2, agg2terra)

### Aggregate GRaster by a non-integer factor in 2 dimensions
# fasterRaster
agg2.9 <- aggregate(elev, 2.9, "mean")

# terra
agg2.9terra <- aggregate(madElev, 2.9, "mean")

# These should be different.
res(agg2.9)
