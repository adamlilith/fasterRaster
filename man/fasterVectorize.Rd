\title{Convert a raster to a vector (points, lines, or polygons)}
\usage{
fasterVectorize(rast, vectType, agg = TRUE, smooth = FALSE,
  grassDir = NULL, alreadyInGrass = FALSE, grassToR = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rast}{Either a raster or the name of a raster in an existing GRASS session.}

\item{vectType}{Character, Indicates type of output: \code{point}, \code{line} (not supported yet), or \code{area}.}

\item{agg}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} (default) then union all points/lines/polygons with the same value into the same "multipart" polygon. This may or may not be desirable. For example, if the raster is vectorized into a polygons object each cell will become a separate polygon. Using this option will merge cells with the same value (even if they are not spatially adjacent one another).}

\item{smooth}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} then "round" cell corners by connecting the midpoints of corner cells (which leaves out the corner-most triangle of that cell). This option only applies if \code{vectType} is \code{area}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{grassDir}{Either \code{NULL} or a 3-element character vector. If the latter, the first element is the base path to the installation of GRASS, the second the version number, and the third the install type for GRASS.  For example, \code{c('C:/OSGeo4W64/', 'grass-7.4.1', 'osgeo4W')}. See \code{\link[link2GI]{linkGRASS7}} for further help. If \code{NULL} (default) the an installation of GRASS is searched for; this may take several minutes.}

\item{alreadyInGrass}{Logical, if \code{FALSE} (default) then start a new GRASS session and import the raster named in \code{rast}. If \code{FALSE}, use a raster already in GRASS with the name given by \code{rast}. The latter is useful if you are chaining \pkg{fasterRaster} functions together and the first function initializes the session. The first function should use \code{alreadyInGrass = FALSE} and subsequent functions should use \code{alreadyInGrass = TRUE} then use their \code{rast} (or \code{vect}) arguments to name the raster (or vector) that was made by the previous function.}

\item{grassToR}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} (default) then the product of the calculations will be returned to R. If \code{FALSE}, then the product is left in the GRASS session and named \code{rastToVect}. The latter case is useful (and faster) when chaining several \pkg{fasterRaster} functions together.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to \code{\link[rgrass7]{execGRASS}} when used for converting a raster to a vector (i.e., function \code{r.to.vect} in GRASS).}

\item{calcDensity}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} then calculate density in the moving window. This will create a raster named \code{density} in the GRASS environment if \code{grassToR} is \code{FALSE} or return a raster named \code{density} if \code{grassToR} is \code{TRUE}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{calcConnect}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} then calculate a connectivity raster (conditional probability a cell with a value of 1 has a value that is also 1) in the moving window. This will create a raster named \code{connect} in the GRASS environment if \code{grassToR} is \code{FALSE} or return a raster named \code{connect} if \code{grassToR} is \code{TRUE}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{grassToR} if \code{TRUE}, then a SpatialPointsDataFrame, SpatialLinesDataFrame, or a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the same coordinate reference system as \code{rast}. The field named \code{value} will have the raster values. Otherwise, vector object named \code{vectToRast} a  will be written into the GRASS session.
}
\description{
This function is a potentially faster version of the function \code{\link[raster]{rasterToPolygons}} in the \pkg{raster} package. It can convert a raster to points or polygons (conversion to lines is not yet supported, although it is possible using the \code{r.to.vect} function in GRASS).
}
\details{
See (r.to.vect)[https://grass.osgeo.org/grass74/manuals/r.to.vect.html] for more details.  Note that if you get an error saying "", then you should add the EPSG code to the beginning of the raster and vector coordinate reference system string (their "proj4string"). For example, \code{proj4string(x) <- CRS('+init=epsg:32738')}. EPSG codes for various projections, datums, and locales can be found at (Spatial Reference)[http://spatialreference.org/].
