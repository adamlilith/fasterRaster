\title{Create a GRaster or GVector}
\usage{
\S4method{fast}{character}(x, rastOrVect = NULL, method = NULL, trim = TRUE, warn = TRUE)

\S4method{fast}{SpatRaster}(x)

\S4method{fast}{stars}(x)

\S4method{fast}{SpatVector}(x)

\S4method{fast}{sf}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Any one of:
\itemize{
\item A \code{SpatRaster} or \code{stars} raster. Rasters can have one or more layers. They will retain their "layerdness" in most \strong{fasterRaster} functions.
\item A \code{SpatVector} or \code{sf} spatial vector.
\item A character string with the path and filename of a raster or vector to be loaded directly into \strong{GRASS}. The function will attempt to ascertain the type of object from the file extension (raster or vector), but it can help to indicate which it is using the \code{rastOrVect} argument if it is unclear.
}}

\item{rastOrVect}{Either \code{NULL} (default) or character (\code{'raster'} or \code{'vector'}). If \code{x} is a raster or vector already in \strong{R}, this does not need to be specified. However, if \code{x} is a filename, then the function will try to ascertain the data type from the filenames, but sometimes this will fail. In that case, it can help to specify if the file holds a raster or vector. Partial matching is used.}

\item{method}{Character or \code{NULL} (rasters only): If \code{x} does not have the same coordinate reference system as the currently active \strong{GRASS} \link[=tutorial_sessions]{session}, then it will be projected when it is imported. You may need to specify which method is used to conduction the transformation. Partial matching is used.
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default): Automatically choose based on raster properties (\code{near} for categorical data, \code{bilinear} for continuous data)
\item \code{'near'}: Nearest neighbor. Best for categorical data, and often a poor choice for continuous data.
\item \code{'bilinear'}: Bilinear interpolation (default for non-categorical data; uses weighted values from 4 cells).
\item \code{'bicubic'}: Bicubic interpolation (uses weighted values from 16 cells).
\item \code{'lanczos'}: Lanczos interpolation (uses weighted values from 25 cells).
}}

\item{trim}{Logical (rasters only): When importing rasters from disk that "wrap around" (i.e., whole-world rasters or rasters that have edges that actually circle around to meet on the globe), \code{trim} should be \code{FALSE} to avoid removing rows and columns from the "edge" of the map.}

\item{warn}{Logical: If \code{TRUE}, display a warning when projecting the vector or raster.}
}
\value{
A \code{GRaster} or \code{GVector}.
}
\description{
To use most \strong{fasterRaster} functions, you need to
\enumerate{
\item Initiate a \strong{GRASS} session with \code{\link[=faster]{faster()}};
\item Then use \code{fast()} to either:
\itemize{
\item Convert a \code{SpatRaster}, \code{SpatVector}, \code{sf} object, or \code{stars} raster to a \code{GRaster} or \code{GVector},
\item Load a raster or vector from a file directly into the \code{GRaster} or \code{GVector} format. \strong{GRASS} supports loading from disk a variety of raster (see the \strong{GRASS} manual page for \code{r.in.gdal}) and vector(see the \strong{GRASS} manual page for \code{v.in.ogr}) formats, though not all of them will work with this function.
}
}
}
\details{
When projecting a raster, the "fallback" methods in \code{r.import} are actually used, even though the \code{method} argument takes the strings for non-fallback methods. See the manual page for the \code{r.import} \strong{GRASS} module.
