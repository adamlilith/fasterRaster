\title{Slope, aspect, curvature, and partial slopes}
\usage{
\S4method{terrain}{GRaster}(x, v = "slope", units = "degrees", northIs0 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{GRaster} (typically representing elevation).}

\item{v}{Name of the topographic metric(s) to calculate. Valid values include one or more of:
\itemize{
\item \code{'slope'}: Slope. Units are given by argument \code{units}.
\item \code{'aspect'}: Aspect. When argument \code{northIs0} is \code{TRUE} (default), then aspect is given in degrees from north going clockwise (0 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south, 270 = west).
\item \code{'profileCurve'}: Profile curvature.
\item \code{'tanCurve'}: Tangential curvature.
\item \code{'dx'}: Slope in east-west direction.
\item \code{'dy'}: Slope in north-south direction.
\item \code{'dxx'}: Second partial derivative in east-west direction.
\item \code{'dyy'}: Second partial derivative in north-south direction.
\item \code{'dxy'}: Second partial derivative along east-west and north-south direction.
\item \code{'*'}: All of the above.
}}

\item{units}{Character: "Units" in which to calculate slope: either \code{'degrees'} for degrees (default) or \code{'percent'}.}

\item{northIs0}{Logical: If \code{TRUE} (default), aspect will be reported in "north orientation," such that 0 is north, and degrees run clockwise (90 is east, 180 south, 270 west). If \code{FALSE}, then aspect will be reported in "east orientation," such that 0 is east, and degrees run counterclockwise (90 is north, 180 west, 270 south). The latter is the default in \strong{GRASS}, but the former is the default in \code{\link[terra:terrain]{terra::terrain()}} function, so is used here as the default. \strong{Note:} The \code{\link[=sun]{sun()}} function requires aspect to be in east orientation.}
}
\value{
A \code{GRaster} with one or more layers.
}
\description{
\code{terrain()} calculates topographic indices, including slope, aspect, curvature, and partial slopes (slopes in the east-west or north-south directions).
