\title{Group adjacent cells with similar values}
\usage{
\S4method{clump}{GRaster}(x, minDiff = 0, minClumpSize = 1, diagonal = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{GRaster}.}

\item{minDiff}{Numeric in the range [0, 1): Minimum difference between cells in order for them to be assigned to the same clump. This is a proportion of the range across all cells. For example, if \code{minDiff} is set to 0.01, then the maximum difference between cells in a clump can be up to 1\% of the entire range across all cells. Small values can create large clumps. The default is 0, in which case values have to be exactly the same.}

\item{minClumpSize}{Numeric integer >= 1. Minimum number of cells in a clump. The default is 1.}

\item{diagonal}{Logical: If \code{TRUE} (default), then cells "connected" at corners will be included as part of the same clump.}
}
\value{
A \code{GRaster}.
}
\description{
\code{clump()} identifies groups of adjacent cells that have the same value or same approximate value, and assigns them a unique number, creating "clumps" of same- or similar-valued cells.

\examples{

# Setup
library(sf)
library(terra)

# Elevation raster
madElev <- fastData("madElev")

# Convert a SpatRaster to a GRaster:
elev <- fast(madElev)

# Find clumps based on exact values. This will appear as a gradient because
# most cells are assigned to a group of 1 cell.
exact <- clump(elev)
plot(exact)

# Clump based on approximate values:
approx <- clump(elev, minDiff = 0.0075)
plot(approx)

# Clump based on approximate values with minimum clump size
# (this can take a minute or two):
approx20 <- clump(elev, minDiff = 0.005, minClumpSize = 20)
plot(approx20)
