\title{Combine two GVectors}
\usage{
\S4method{union}{GVector,GVector}(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{\code{GVector}s representing polygons.}
}
\value{
A \code{GVector}.
}
\description{
The \code{union()} function combines two "polygons" \code{GVector}s. The output will have at least as many geometries as both \code{GVector}s, plus more if polygons of one divide polygons of the other, and vice versa. You can also use the \code{+} operator (e.g., \code{vect1 + vect2}).

# NB This example is in a "dontrun{}" block because it requires users to have
# GRASS GIS Version 8+ installed on their system.

# IMPORTANT #1: If you already have a GRASS session started, you will need to
# run the line below and the last line in this example to work with it again.
# If you have not started a GRASS session, you can skip this step and go to
# step #2.

# IMPORTANT #2: Select the appropriate line below and change as necessary to
# where GRASS is installed on your system.

# Polygon of coastal Madagascar and Dypsis specimens

# Start GRASS session for examples only:

# Convert vectors:
coast4 <- fast(madCoast4)
dypsis <- fast(madDypsis)

# Create another polygons vector from a convex hull around Dypsis points

### union()

### intersect
#############

### xor
#######

### not
#######

# IMPORTANT #3: Revert back to original GRASS session if needed.
