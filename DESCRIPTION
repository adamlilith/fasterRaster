Title: Faster raster processing in R using GRASS GIS
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Adam B. Smith <adam@earthSkySea.org>
Maintainer: Adam B. Smith <adam@earthSkySea.org>
Description: This package is meant as an add-on to the raster
    package package. It uses multi-core processing and GRASS GIS
	Version 7 to do some of the more laborious raster operations
	faster than what can be done using the raster package. For
	smaller rasters functions in the raster package may actually
	be faster. Note that to use many of the functions in this
	package you must have GRASS 7 installed on your system.
