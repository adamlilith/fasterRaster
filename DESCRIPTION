Description: Processing of large-in-memory/large-on disk rasters and spatial
	vectors using 'GRASS GIS'. Most functions in the 'terra' package are
	recreated. Processing of medium-sized and smaller spatial objects will
	nearly always be faster using 'terra' or 'sf', but for large-in-memory/
	large-on-disk objects, 'fasterRaster' may be faster. To use most of the
	functions, you must have the stand-alone version (not the 'OSGeoW4'
	installer version) of 'GRASS GIS' 8.0 or higher.
