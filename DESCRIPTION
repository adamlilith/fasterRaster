Description: This package is meant as an add-on to the raster
    package. It uses multi-core processing and GRASS GIS
	Version 7.8 to do some of the more laborious raster
	operations faster than what can be done using the raster
	package. For smaller rasters functions in the raster package
	may actually be faster, and the terra package most likely
	will. Note that to use many of the functions in this
	package you must have the stand-alone version  (not the
	OSGeo version) of GRASS 7.8 installed on your system. It
	has not been tested with versions higher than 7.8, but it
	might work!
