Description: Processing of large-in-memory/-on disk rasters and spatial vectors
    using 'GRASS GIS'. Most functions in 'terra' and 'sf' are recreated
	identically or near-identically, and can stand in for them when rasters or
	vectors are extremely large. Processing of medium-sized and smaller spatial
	objects will nearly always be faster using 'terra' or 'sf'. To use most of
	the functions you must have the stand-alone version (not the 'OSGeoW4'
	installer version) of 'GRASS GIS' 8.0 or higher.
