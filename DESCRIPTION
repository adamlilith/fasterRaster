Description: Faster raster and spatial vector processing using 'GRASS GIS' and
	`multi-core	processing. Standard functions include projecting and
	resampling, rasterizing, cropping, and other usual raster/vector operations.
	Speciality functions include calculation of landscape (i.e., forest)
	fragmentation indices (Riitters et al. 2000)<https::https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol4/iss2/art3/>,
	custom focal functions, and generation of fractal landscapes. This package
	is not a replacement for 'terra' or 'sf', but rather offers support for
	cases where functions in those packages fail or otherwise are very slow
	owing to memory requirements. Note that to use many of the functions you
	must have the stand-alone version (not insalled through the 'OSGeoW4'
	installer) of 'GRASS GIS' 8.2 or higher.
Depends:
	R (>= 4.0.0)
