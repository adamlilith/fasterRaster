Description: Making raster and vector processing faster using
	GRASS GIS! This package uses multi-core processing and
	GRASS GIS Version 7.8 to do some of the more laborious
	raster/vector operations faster than what can be done
	using the raster, terra, or sf packages. For smaller
	rasters or vectors, functions in the raster, terra, or
	sf packages may actually be faster, but in some cases,
	fasterRaster will be faster! Note that to use
	many of the functions in this package you must have the
	stand-alone version  (not the OSGeo version) of GRASS
	7.8 installed on your system. It has not been tested
	with versions higher than 7.8, but it might work!
