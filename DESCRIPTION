Description: This package is meant as an add-on to the raster
    package. It uses multi-core processing and GRASS GIS
	Version 7.8 to do some of the more laborious raster
	operations faster than what can be done using the raster
	package. For smaller rasters functions in the raster package
	may actually be faster, and the terra package definitely
	will. Note that to use many of the functions in this
	package you must have the stand-alone version of GRASS 7.8
	installed on your system.
