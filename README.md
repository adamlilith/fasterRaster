# fasterRaster

This package uses GRASS GIS Version 7 to speed up some commonly used raster operations. Most/all of these operations can be done using the **raster** package by Robert Hijmans.  However, when the input raster is very large in memory, functions in that package can take a long time (days!) and fail. The **fasterRaster** package attempts to address these problems by calls to (GRASS GIS Version 7)[https://grass.osgeo.org/grass7/] which is faster for large rasters. To use the package Version 7 of GRASS must be installed (the sub-version is unimportant) on the local system you are using.
