For most rasters and vectors that are small or medium-sized in memory/disk, those packages will almost always be faster. They may also be faster for very large objects.  But when they aren't, fasterRaster can step in.
Installing fasterRaster


You probably already have fasterRaster installed on your computer, but if not, you can install the latest release version from CRAN using:
install.packages(&quot;fasterRaster&quot;)

and the latest development version using:
remotes::install_github(&quot;adamlilith/fasterRaster&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)

(You may need to install the remotes package first.)



Installing GRASS GIS


fasterRaster uses GRASS to do its operations. You will need to install GRASS using the &quot;stand-alone&quot; installer, available through the GRASS GIS. Be sure to use the &quot;stand-alone&quot; installer, not the &quot;OSGeo4W&quot; installer!



Starting a fasterRaster session


I recommend attaching the data.table, terra, and sf packages before attaching fasterRaster package to avoid function conflicts. The data.table package is not required, but you most surely will use at least one of the other two.
library(data.table)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(fasterRaster)

To begin, you need to tell fasterRaster the full file path of the folder where GRASS is installed on your system. Where this is well depend on your operating system and the version of GRASS installed.  Three examples below show you what this might look like, but you may need to change the file path to match your case:
grassDir &amp;lt;- &quot;C:/Program Files/GRASS GIS 8.3&quot; # Windows
grassDir &amp;lt;- &quot;/Applications/GRASS-8.3.app/Contents/Resources&quot; # Mac OS
grassDir &amp;lt;- &quot;/usr/local/grass&quot; # Linux

To tell fasterRaster where GRASS is installed, use the faster() function:
faster(grassDir = grassDir)

You can also use the faster() function to set options that affect how fasterRaster functions run. This includes setting the amount of maximum memory and number of computer cores allocated to operations.
In fasterRaster, rasters are called GRasters and vectors are called GVectors. The easiest (but not always fastest) way to start using a GRaster or GVector is to convert it from one already in R. In the example below, we use a raster that comes with the fasterRaster package. The raster represents elevation of a portion of eastern Madagascar. We first load the SpatRaster using fastData(), a helper function for loading example data objects that come with the fasterRaster package.
madElev &amp;lt;- fastData(&quot;madElev&quot;) # example SpatRaster
madElev

Now, we do the conversion to a GRaster and a GVector using fast(). This function can create a GRaster or GVector from a SpatRaster, a SpatVector, a sf vector, or a file representing a raster or vector.
elev &amp;lt;- fast(madElev)
elev

Converting rasters and vectors that are already in R to GRasters and GVectors takes some time. Instead, you can load a raster or vector directly from disk to a fasterRaster session using fast(). To do this, you just replace the first argument in fast() with a string representing the folder path and file name of the raster you want to load into the session. For example, you can do:
rastFile &amp;lt;- system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;madElev.tif&quot;), package = &quot;fasterRaster&quot;)
elev2 &amp;lt;- fast(rastFile)

Now, let's create a GVector. The fast() function can take a SpatVector from the terra package, an sf object from the sf package, or a string representing the file path and file name of a vector file (e.g., a GeoPackage file or a shapefile).
madRivers &amp;lt;- fastData(&quot;madRivers&quot;) # sf vector
madRivers

rivers &amp;lt;- fast(madRivers)
rivers




Operations on GRasters and GVectors


You can do operations on these objects just like you would if they were SpatRasters, SpatVectors, and sf objects. For example, you can use mathematical operators and functions:
elev_feet &amp;lt;- elev * 3.28084
elev_feet

log10Elev &amp;lt;- log10(elev)
log10Elev

You can also use the many fasterRaster functions. In general, these functions have the same names as their terra counterparts and often the same arguments. Note that even many terra and fasterRaster functions have the same name, they do not necessarily produce the exact same output. Much care has been taken to ensure they do, but sometimes there are multiple ways to do the same task, so choices made by the authors of terra and GRASS can lead to differences.
The following code creates a a) raster where cell values reflect the distance between them and the nearest river; b) creates a buffer around the rivers; then c) plots the output:
dist &amp;lt;- distance(elev, rivers)
dist

riverBuff &amp;lt;- buffer(rivers, 10000)
riversBuff

plot(dist)
plot(rivers, col = 'blue', add = TRUE)
plot(riversBuff, add = TRUE)

And that's how you get started! Now that you have a raster and a vector in your fasterRaster &quot;location&quot;, you can start doing manipulations and analyses using any of the fasterRaster functions!  To see an annotated list of these functions, use ?fasterRaster.



Converting and saving GRasters and GVectors


You can convert a GRaster to a SpatRaster raster using rast():
terraElev &amp;lt;- rast(elev)

To convert a GVector to the terra package's SpatVector format or to an sf vector, use vect() or st_as_sf():
terraRivers &amp;lt;- vect(rivers)
sfRivers &amp;lt;- st_as_sf(rivers)

Finally, you can use writeRaster() and writeVector() to save GRasters and GVectors directly to disk. This will always be faster than using rast(), vect(), or st_as_sf() then saving the result from those functions.
elevTempFile &amp;lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.tif&quot;) # save as GeoTIFF
writeRaster(elev, elevTempFile)

vectTempFile &amp;lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.shp&quot;) # save as shapefile
writeVector(rivers, vectTempFile)




Tips for masking fasterRaster faster


Loading rasters and vectors directly from disk using fast(), rather than converting terra or sf objects is faster. Why? Because if the object does not have a file to which the R object points, fast() has to save it to disk first as a GeoTIFF or GeoPackage file, then load it into GRASS.
Similarly, saving GRasters and GVectors directly to disk will always be faster than converting them to SpatRasters or SpatVectors using rast() or vect(), then saving them. Why? Because rast() and vect() actually save the object to a temporary file then uses the respective function from the respective package to create the SpatRaster/SpatVector/sf` vector, which you would then proceed to save to disk again.
Every time you switch between using a GRaster or GVector with a different coordinate reference system (CRS), GRASS has to spend a few second changing to that CRS. So, you can save some time by doing as much work as possible with objects in one CRS, then switching to work on objects in another CRS.
By default, GRASS/fasterRaster use 2 cores and 2048 MB (2 GB) of memory for functions that allow users to specify these values. You can set these to higher values using faster() and thus potentially speed up some calculations. Functions in newer versions of GRASS have more capacity to use these options, so updating GRASS to the latest version can help, too.
To obviate problems with disk space filling up, by default most fasterRaster functions delete intermediate files. However, if you are not creating a lot of very big GRasters or GVectors, you can skip this time-taking step by setting the clean option to FALSE using faster(clean = FALSE). You can also use the mow() function to remove from the disk cache any GRASS files that are not associated with a GRaster or GVector in memory. This can be helpful, say, if you create a series of objects, then re-assign them using, say old_name &amp;lt;- new_object or remove them using rm(old_name). You removed them from R, but the files they pointed to are still in the GRASS cache.
Its name notwithstanding, fasterRaster is just not going to be as fast as terra or sf for all operations, even when the objects are big in memory or on disk. If you are struggling to analyze an object, you can try respective functions in the other packages.

<p>You can do operations on these objects just like you would if they were <code>SpatRaster</code>s, <code>SpatVector</code>s, and <code>sf</code> objects. For example, you can use mathematical operators and functions:</p>
<p></p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>elev_feet <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> elev <span class="sc">*</span> <span class="fl">3.28084</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a>elev_feet</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a>log10Elev <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">log10</span>(elev)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" tabindex="-1"></a>log10Elev</span></code></pre><p></p></div>
<p>You can also use the many <strong>fasterRaster</strong> functions. In general, these functions have the same names as their <strong>terra</strong> counterparts and often the same arguments. Note that even many <strong>terra</strong> and <strong>fasterRaster</strong> functions have the same name, they do not necessarily produce the exact same output. Much care has been taken to ensure they do, but sometimes there are multiple ways to do the same task, so choices made by the authors of <strong>terra</strong> and <strong>GRASS</strong> can lead to differences.</p>
<p>The following code creates a a) raster where cell values reflect the distance between them and the nearest river; b) creates a buffer around the rivers; then c) plots the output:</p>
<p></p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>dist <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">distance</span>(elev, rivers)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a>dist</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a>riverBuff <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">buffer</span>(rivers, <span class="dv">10000</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" tabindex="-1"></a>riversBuff</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">plot</span>(dist)</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">plot</span>(rivers, <span class="at">col =</span> <span class="st">'blue'</span>, <span class="at">add =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">plot</span>(riversBuff, <span class="at">add =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre><p></p></div>
<p>And that's how you get started! Now that you have a raster and a vector in your <strong>fasterRaster</strong> "location", you can start doing manipulations and analyses using any of the <strong>fasterRaster</strong> functions!  To see an annotated list of these functions, use <code><a href="fasterRaster.html">?fasterRaster</a></code>.</p>

<p>You can convert a <code>GRaster</code> to a <code>SpatRaster</code> raster using <code><a href="rast.html">rast()</a></code>:</p>
<p></p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>terraElev <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">rast</span>(elev)</span></code></pre><p></p></div>
<p>To convert a <code>GVector</code> to the <strong>terra</strong> package's <code>SpatVector</code> format or to an <code>sf</code> vector, use <code><a href="vect.html">vect()</a></code> or <code><a href="vect.html">st_as_sf()</a></code>:</p>
<p></p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>terraRivers <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">vect</span>(rivers)</span>

<p>Finally, you can use <code><a href="writeRaster.html">writeRaster()</a></code> and <code><a href="writeVector.html">writeVector()</a></code> to save <code>GRaster</code>s and <code>GVector</code>s directly to disk. This will always be faster than using <code><a href="rast.html">rast()</a></code>, <code><a href="vect.html">vect()</a></code>, or <code><a href="vect.html">st_as_sf()</a></code> then saving the result from those functions.</p>
<p></p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>elevTempFile <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">tempfile</span>(<span class="at">fileext =</span> <span class="st">".tif"</span>) <span class="co"># save as GeoTIFF</span></span>

<h3 id="tips-for-masking-fasterraster-faster">Tips for masking <strong>fasterRaster</strong> faster<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tips-for-masking-fasterraster-faster"></a></h3>

<ol><li><p>Loading rasters and vectors directly from disk using <code><a href="fast.html">fast()</a></code>, rather than converting <strong>terra</strong> or <strong>sf</strong> objects is faster. Why? Because if the object does not have a file to which the <strong>R</strong> object points, <code><a href="fast.html">fast()</a></code> has to save it to disk first as a GeoTIFF or GeoPackage file, then load it into <strong>GRASS</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, saving <code>GRaster</code>s and <code>GVector</code>s directly to disk will always be faster than converting them to <code>SpatRaster</code>s or <code>SpatVector</code>s using <code><a href="rast.html">rast()</a></code> or <code><a href="vect.html">vect()</a></code>, then saving them. Why? Because <code><a href="rast.html">rast()</a></code> and <code>vect() actually save the object to a temporary file then uses the respective function from the respective package to create the </code>SpatRaster<code>/</code>SpatVector<code>/</code>sf` vector, which you would then proceed to save to disk again.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time you switch between using a <code>GRaster</code> or <code>GVector</code> with a different coordinate reference system (CRS), <strong>GRASS</strong> has to spend a few second changing to that CRS. So, you can save some time by doing as much work as possible with objects in one CRS, then switching to work on objects in another CRS.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, <strong>GRASS</strong>/<strong>fasterRaster</strong> use 2 cores and 2048 MB (2 GB) of memory for functions that allow users to specify these values. You can set these to higher values using <code><a href="faster.html">faster()</a></code> and thus potentially speed up some calculations. Functions in newer versions of <strong>GRASS</strong> have more capacity to use these options, so updating <strong>GRASS</strong> to the latest version can help, too.</p></li>
<li><p>To obviate problems with disk space filling up, by default most <strong>fasterRaster</strong> functions delete intermediate files. However, if you are not creating a lot of very big <code>GRaster</code>s or <code>GVector</code>s, you can skip this time-taking step by setting the <code>clean</code> option to <code>FALSE</code> using <code>faster(clean = FALSE)</code>. You can also use the <code><a href="mow.html">mow()</a></code> function to remove from the disk cache any <strong>GRASS</strong> files that are not associated with a <code>GRaster</code> or <code>GVector</code> in memory. This can be helpful, say, if you create a series of objects, then re-assign them using, say <code>old_name &lt;- new_object</code> or remove them using <code>rm(old_name)</code>. You removed them from <strong>R</strong>, but the files they pointed to are still in the <strong>GRASS</strong> cache.</p></li>
<li><p>Its name notwithstanding, <strong>fasterRaster</strong> is just not going to be as fast as <strong>terra</strong> or <strong>sf</strong> for all operations, even when the objects are big in memory or on disk. If you are struggling to analyze an object, you can try respective functions in the other packages.</p></li>
